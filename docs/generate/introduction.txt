@title(Overview)
@shorttitle(pasc)

The pasc is a cross-platform command line tool that is intended to help with the development process of @html(<a href="https://www.freepascal.org/">Free Pascal</a>) / @html(<a href="https://www.lazarus-ide.org/">Lazarus</a>) projects, assisting during development, testing, build and documentation.

It allows you to create projects, add tests, add automation to documentation, in addition to providing a watch command to monitor the projects folder for changes and thereby trigger the build and test report process.

An interesting feature is the ease with which a new project can be configured to work with vscode providing configuration files for build, to run tests, and even for watch project folder and to trigger build and tests.

@section(1 SecSecond Requirements)

This tool was tested with @bold(FPC 3.2.2) and @bold(Lazarus 2.2.2), but it may work with other versions. Should work under Linux, MacOS and Windows.

To work with the project using @bold(vscode) you will going to need the following requirements:

@unorderedList(
  @item(a vscode extension that provides code completion, syntax check, etc for FreePascal, @html(<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Wosi.omnipascal">OmniPascal</a>) is a good one.)
  @item(a vscode extension to debug your project, the launch.json file generated by pasc is using @html(<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CNOC.fpdebug">Free Pascal (fpc) Debugger</a>) extension, but you can change it to one of your preference).
  @item(@bold(lazbuild) should be in the path, pasc uses it to build the projects and the tests projects. You can find @bold(lazbuild) on @bold(Lazarus) tools sub folder.)
)

Optional items that can improve the experience:

@unorderedList(
  @item(@bold(vscode) should be in the path. Some examples might suggest to type "code ." to open the editor directly from the prompt.)
  @item(@bold(git) command line should be in the path.)
