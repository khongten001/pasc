@section(1 SecFirst Description)

This command just calls lazbuild to perform the build, if you want to compile the project manually, we recommend using the lazbuild tool or the fpc compiler itself for that.

The reason behind the existence of this command along with pasc is only for the implementation of the watch command.

Example:
@longCode(
  pasc build HelloWorld.lpi
)
