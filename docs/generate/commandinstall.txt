@section(1 SecFirst Description)

Installs pasc in the user's home folder, for that it creates a subfolder called .pasc and copies the executable itself to that folder. Also, add the new folder to the path environment variable so that you can call pasc from any folder.

@note(It is recommended to restart our terminal session for the addition to the path to take effect. For MacOS you need to use elevation before running this command.)

Example:
@longCode(
  ./pasc install
)
